# Book Search Engine

## Description
This project focuses on building a book search engine, allowing the user to search various books and saving them to a profile that is created by signing up or to an already existing profile that was logged into. This project is designed using the MERN (MongoDB/ExpressJS/ReactJS/NodeJS) stack and was used as a way to learn and put into practice the previously mentioned technologies.

## Installation
All packages must be installed for both client and server as well as the 'Concurrently' package for the root folder. All packages can be installed via the 'npm install' or 'npm i' commands.

## Usage
Upon launching the server and client, the user will be brought to a search page where they may search for any book. The user must be logged in, either logging in or signing up via the button in top right. After successfully logging in, the user may save any book that comes up in the search results. However, as of currently, this feature is yet to be implemented.
